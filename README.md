# Chatroom

A really short class project where each duo had to build a web app to connect to a single Socket.io server. I tried Svelte for the first time to build it as it seems a great way to give it a try in a short project.

## Web app

..describe web app

## Instructions given

A duo of designer and developer has been randomly formed and we had to design and build a simple web chatroom.
The requirement for the chatroom were:

- Display all received messages
- Set a user with username for each session opened
- Send message as this user
- Display all currently connected users
- Delete one of our previous messages

All groups in class are connected to the same Socket.io server. We could do Pull Request to the server code to add custom functionality to our chat.
